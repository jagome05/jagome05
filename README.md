## Background

### Software Development  
After I had graduated Pharmacy school, I became more interested in how a Pharmacist could apply their background in the digital space. I had reached out to Pharmacists on linked in with varying roles and titles to get some insight. I decided on getting more expereince with software developemnt by enrolling in a Sofware Development Bootcmamp. I attended a bootcamp through Old Dominion University who partnered with Upright Education so I could learn the basics of coding. Throughout the bootcamp I had learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, MERN Stack. My final Capstone Project involved designing a Coaching Website for our sponsor that applied all I learned on top of integrating 3rd party APIs that our sponsor wanted.

### Healthcare Background  
I graduated Old Dominion University back in 2018 with a B.S. in Chemistry and Biochemistry. I wanted to become a pharmacist so I atttended Virginia Commonwealth University and graduated with my PharmD in 2023. Throughout my time in pharmacy I learned a lot about healthcare and the clinical role that pharmacists had to help patients. During my last year in clinical rotations, I had followed a Pharmacist who focused on Informatics. I saw an entirely different world that Pharmacist could apply their knowledge to, so I decided to shift my career goals to somewhere in the Digital Healthcare sector.
